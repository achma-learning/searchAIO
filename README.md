# used gemini-cli : https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli   \ inside wsl-ubuntu
# with github desktop
# + claude-AI to analyse for errors and suggestions

this is a poor readme:
to chose search engin either chose with mouse the radio button or type "prefix:" , or use keyboard shortcuts

# you can use duckduckgo bang inside google
# i tried to name search "prefix:" same or close to duckduckgo !bang
here a good website about duckduckgo !bangs : https://mosermichael.github.io/duckduckbang/html/main.html
and i think of adding search operator to main search engin
and in yandex and baidu ... , add a translation for those who doesn't speek the language, where at top of search bar you have search translation like now in yandex , and i think of adding a small button at right of this popout to open a google translate or deepl translate page, and at buttom you have search operator

# then make this default start page, or custom new tab extension
# i am a noob at coding but using gemini-cli , and claude AI and some other ai helped me, there is some error as of now 2026-01-19 reported by claude ai , but i can't fixe them yet without breaking functionnality
# this help me supercharge my moves : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsQACpcuTkU , since i can copy all of gemini or grok (website AI) discurssion and past them in a .txt folder and tell gemini-cli in prompt : to read the @grok-test.txt and try to fix/update/correct errors
