# used gemini-cli : https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli   \ inside wsl-ubuntu
# with github desktop
# + claude-AI to analyse for errors and suggestions



this is a poor readme:
to chose search engin either chose with mouse the radio button or type "prefix:" , or use keyboard shortcuts

# you can use duckduckgo bang inside google
# i tried to name search "prefix:" same or close to duckduckgo !bang
and i think of adding search operator to main search engin
and in yandex and baidu ... , add a translation for those who doesn't speek the language, where at top of search bar you have search translation like now in yandex , and i think of adding a small button at right of this popout to open a google translate or deepl translate page, and at buttom you have search operator
